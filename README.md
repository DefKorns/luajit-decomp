LuaJIT decompiler (or more of a bytecode re-assembler)
======================================================

Here's a thing I done made that re-assembles LuaJIT from it's assembly-bytecode (or when used with LuaJIT itself can decompile LuaJIT files)

# Warning

This repo is currently in a state of flux.

For the old .exe's take a look at the [deprecated branch](/bobsayshilol/luajit-decomp/tree/deprecated).

For new code that's readable (but may never be completed) take a look at the [reimplementation branch](/bobsayshilol/luajit-decomp/tree/reimplementation).


### If you have any questions on how to use it then read the wiki ###

Things that still need to be added:
* lots
* table lookups
* uget lookups (if thats possible?)

By using this you agree that you will not modify anything for malicious purposes, or redistribute source code (decompiled or not) of anything using LuaJIT
